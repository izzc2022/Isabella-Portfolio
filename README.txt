Hi there,
This application features custom programming within the 'text_entry_window_isabella.py' file.
The application functions as follows:
1. Draw a word with the gesture keyboard
2. if the word is a potential command, a popup box appears, asking if the word 'is a command'?
3. Pressing 'yes' actions a new window, confirming successful operation, whilst selecting 'no' inputs the word as regular text
