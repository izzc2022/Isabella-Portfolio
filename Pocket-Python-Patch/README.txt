"Pocket Python Patch" is a concept text-based farming sim that is currently under development by Isabella C. 
Isabella began developing this python simulator at the beginning of 2023, and is currently progressing with it piece by piece.
Whilst the game can be run, a notification will be made when the game is fully executable without error and can be played properly.

Due to issues I'm experiencing with absolute paths in github, all the "Pocket Python Patch" files exist outside this folder, but still within this repository.
All file names begin with "farm_".
