IMPORTANT NOTE: My university owns ALL of these code files, but I own my edits and implementations within the 'text_entry_window_.py' file. The publishing of these files is for context purposes ONLY, 
as the assignment relied on making minor adjustments to a particular file, in order to showcase the ability to interpret existing code and add functionality based on the files and context given, 
as well as use problem solving skills and critical thinking to determine a new minor feature with relevant bug control and ease of use. I do not claim to own these files: I only own my work and contributions.

Hi there,
This application features custom programming within the 'text_entry_window_isabella.py' file.
The application functions as follows:
1. Draw a word with the gesture keyboard
2. if the word is a potential command, a popup box appears, asking if the word 'is a command'?
3. Pressing 'yes' actions a new window, confirming successful operation, whilst selecting 'no' inputs the word as regular text
