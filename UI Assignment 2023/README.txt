IMPORTANT NOTE: My university owns ALL of these code files, but I own my edits and implementations within the 'text_entry_window_.py' file. The publishing of these files is for context purposes ONLY, 
as the assignment relied on making minor adjustments to a particular file, in order to showcase the ability to interpret existing code and add functionality based on the files and context given, 
as well as use problem solving skills and critical thinking to determine a new minor feature with relevant bug control and ease of use. I do not claim to own these files: I only own my work and contributions.

Hi there,
This application features custom programming within the 'text_entry_window_.py' file.
The application functions as follows:
1. Run the 'text_entry_window.py' file
2. Draw a word with the gesture keyboard
3. if the word is a potential command, a popup box appears, asking if the word 'is a command'?
4. Pressing 'yes' actions a new window, confirming successful operation, whilst selecting 'no' inputs the word as regular text

Please note: This program was designed for an assignment where the objective was to add a new solution or functionality to a 'gesture keyboard' application.
All the code files belong to the university, but my solution is included within the 'text_entry_window.py' file (check comments for my major implementations).
I do not own the files or code, only my own edits, functionality and changes. I have attached the entire assignment to showcase my python user interface skills and familiarity,
as well as my problem-solving abilities and syntax comfortability.
