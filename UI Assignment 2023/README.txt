Hi there,
This application features custom programming within the 'text_entry_window_.py' file.
The application functions as follows:
1. Run the 'text_entry_window.py' file
2. Draw a word with the gesture keyboard
3. if the word is a potential command, a popup box appears, asking if the word 'is a command'?
4. Pressing 'yes' actions a new window, confirming successful operation, whilst selecting 'no' inputs the word as regular text

Please note: This program was designed for an assignment where the objective was to add a new solution or functionality to a 'gesture keyboard' application.
All the code files belong to the university, but my solution is included within the 'text_entry_window.py' file (check comments for my major implementations).
I do not own the files or code, only my own edits, functionality and changes. I have attached the entire assignment to showcase my python user interface skills and familiarity,
as well as my problem-solving abilities and syntax comfortability.
